    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Smash burgers are a popular style of burger known for their thin, crispy-edged patties, achieved by pressing ground beef firmly onto a hot griddle or skillet. The smashing process maximizes contact with the cooking surface, creating a flavorful crust through the Maillard reaction. Typically seasoned with just salt and pepper, the focus of a smash burger is on the beef's natural flavor and its caramelized exterior.</p>
    <p>Served on a soft bun, often with melted cheese, pickles, and a tangy sauce, smash burgers are prized for their simplicity and satisfying crunch. Their relatively quick cooking time and customizable toppings make them a favorite at diners, food trucks, and home kitchens alike. The technique and presentation celebrate a minimalist approach to burgers while delivering bold, crave-worthy flavors.</p>
