    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Carbonara is a classic Italian pasta dish that originates from the Lazio region, particularly Rome. It is renowned for its simple yet indulgent combination of ingredients, which include pasta (traditionally spaghetti or rigatoni), eggs, Pecorino Romano cheese, guanciale (cured pork jowl), and black pepper. The hallmark of carbonara is its creamy sauce, created by emulsifying the eggs and cheese with the rendered fat from the guanciale. Unlike cream-based sauces, the richness of carbonara comes purely from the eggs and cheese, making it a unique and authentic representation of Italian culinary traditions.</p>
    <p>The dish is celebrated for its balance of flavors: the salty tang of Pecorino, the savory depth of guanciale, and the mild heat from freshly cracked black pepper. Its preparation requires precision, as the sauce must be combined with the hot pasta quickly to achieve a silky texture without scrambling the eggs. Carbonara has become a staple in Italian cuisine and a beloved dish worldwide, inspiring variations that include bacon or cream, though purists insist on the traditional recipe for its unmatched simplicity and elegance.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>350g of pasta (we recommend either tagliatelle or rigatoni)</li>
        <li>100g of guanciale (this can be subbed for bacon or pancetta)</li>
        <li>50g parmesan</li>
        <li>50g pecorino</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>50g unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 plump garlic cloves</li>
        <li>sea salt & freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Put a large saucepan of water to boil.</li>
        <li>Finely chop the guanciale/pancetta/bacon (if required, some come pre-chopped). Finely grate the parmesan and pecorino & mix the cheeses together.</li>
        <li>Beat the three large eggs in a medium bowl & season with a little freshly ground black pepper. Then mix in the cheese mixture and whisk together.</li>
        <li>Add the pasta to the water and allow this to cook for 10-12 minutes or until al dente.</li>
        <li>Squash the two peeled plump garlic cloves with the edge of a knife, to bruise it.</li>
        <li>Whilst the pasta is cooking, fry the chopped meat with the garlic. Drop the 50g of butter into a large frying pan or wok, and once melted, tip in the meat and garlic.</li>
        <li>Cook on a medium heat for 5 minutes, stirring often, until the meat is golden and crisp. The garlic can be removed as it has imparted its flavor.</li>
        <li>Keep the heat on the meat low. When the pasta is ready, lift it into the frying pan and mix. It is ok for a few drops of the water to end up in, and keep a few tablespoons of the pasta water.</li>
        <li>Take the frying pan off the heat, and pour in the egg and cheese mixture. Stir the mixture into the pasta, ensuring the egg doesn't scramble, until everything is covered.</li>
        <li>Add the extra pasta water to keep it saucey, and add some salt if needed.</li>
        <li>Serve the pasta with a sprinkle of cheese and pepper to garnish.</li>
    </ol>
